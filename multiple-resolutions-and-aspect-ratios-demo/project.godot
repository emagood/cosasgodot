config/name="Multiple Resolutions and Aspect Ratios Demo"
config/description="This project demonstrates how to set up a project to handle screens of
multiple resolutions and aspect ratios.

The GUI can be made to fit the window or constrained to a specific
aspect ratio from a list of common aspect ratios. On ultrawide aspect ratios,
this can be used to prevent HUD elements from being too spread apart,
which can harm the gameplay experience.

For non-essential HUD elements, specific controls can be made to
ignore this aspect ratio constraint when it makes sense
(e.g. a list of players on the side of the screen).

Additionally, a GUI margin setting is provided to better handle TVs
with an overscan area to prevent GUI elements from being cut off.
This can also improve the gameplay experience on large monitors
by bringing HUD elements closer to the center of the screen."
